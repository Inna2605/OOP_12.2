I am one of those who among the first accepted the battle,
I walked forward under the explosions of the guns.
I am a warm blanket of colored dreams
Changed to the hardships of war and the machine gun.
I'm one of those people who separates action from talk,
I beat silently, I did not shout shame.
I am one of those who have long ceased to be afraid of blood,
And the only way is struggle!
I am one of those who go together to the end,
I disobedience destructive wave,
I am the one who ignites hearts with resistance
I am riot, I am chaos, I am war!
